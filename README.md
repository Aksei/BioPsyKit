# BioPsyKit

A Python package for the analysis of biopsychological data.

With this package you have everything you need for analyzing biopsychological data, including:
* Data processing pipelines for biosignals (ECG, EEG, ...)
* Methods for analyzing saliva samples (cortisol, amylase)
* Implementation of various psychological and HCI-related questionnaires

 
Additionally, there are modules to analyze and visualize data acquired from special measurement scenarios, such as:
* Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST)
* ... more to follow

## Details

### Biosignal Analysis
#### ECG Processing
`BioPsyKit` provides a whole ECG data processing pipeline, consisting of:
* Loading ECG data from:
    * generic `.csv` files
    * NilsPod binary (`.bin`) files (requires `NilsPodLib`: https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/NilsPodLib)
    * from other sensor types (_coming soon_)
* Splitting data into chunks (based on time intervals) that will be analyzed separately
* Perform ECG processing, including:
    * R peak detection (using `Neurokit`: https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit)
    * R peak outlier removal and interpolation
    * HRV feature computation
    * ECG-derived respiration (EDR) estimation for respiration rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) (_experimental_)
* Visualization of results

... more biosignals coming soon!

### Biomarker Analysis
`BioPsyKit` provides several methods for the analysis of biomarkers, such as:
* Load saliva data (e.g. cortisol and amylase) from deepwell plate Excel exports
* Compute standard features (maximum increase, slope, AUC, ...)

### Questionnaires
`BioPsyKit` implements various established psychological and HCI-related questionnaires, such as:
* Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
* Positive Appraisal Negative Appraisal Scale (PANAS)
* Self-Compassion Scale (SCS)
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)
* Short Stress State Questionnaire (SSSQ)
* ...

For more details, see the instructions in the `questionnaire` module.

### Stress Protocols
`BioPsyKit` implements methods for analyzing data recorded with several established stress protocols, such as:
* Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST)
* Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) (_coming soon..._) 



## Installation

```

With ssh access:

```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com:mad-lab-fau/BioPsyKit.git --upgrade
```

For development:

```
git clone https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/BioPsyKit.git
cd BioPsyKit
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -e . --upgrade
```

### For Developers under Windows
**Attention!** This repository uses [``pyscaffold-markdown``](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffoldext-markdown) to 
replace the reStructuredText formatted files in the documentation by Markdown format files. For that, symbolic links 
are used to avoid keeping multiple copies of files that are located at the root of the repository but are also needed 
in the documentation generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). This, among others, affects the files 
``README.md``, ``CHANGELOG.md``, or ``AUTHORS.md``.

Under Windows, symbolic links are ignored by default. If you check out this repository under Windows, you need to tell 
Git to keep symbolic links by adding the ``-c core.symlinks=true`` flag to the checkout command (this requires admin 
rights, so either allow non-admins to create symbolic links or run the command as admin):
```
git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/BioPsyKit.git
```
